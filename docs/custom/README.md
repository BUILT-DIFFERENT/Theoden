# Custom References

Use this folder for project-specific instructions, experiment notes, and feature reference material.

Suggested usage:
- `feature-notes/` for rough ideas and future work.
- `instructions/` for one-off build or review guidance.
- `decisions/` for lightweight ADR-style notes.

Keep filenames short and descriptive so they show up well in searches.
