# Docs Index

This folder is organized by purpose so it stays navigable as the project grows.

Sections:

- `product/` — product philosophy, UI specs, and roadmap.
- `platform/` — app-server, worktrees, cloud, and implementation notes.
- `cli/` — user-facing CLI docs, config, and setup.
- `tui/` — terminal UI design and behavior notes.
- `legal/` — contributor, license, and funding info.
- `custom/` — space for project-specific instructions or feature references.
